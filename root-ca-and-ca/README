A root certificate authority, which 1) directly issues the server certificate, and
2) a working certificate authority, which issues the client certificate.

NOTE: This is faithfully implemented according to https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/Using_Certificate_Chains,
but I cannot get OpenVPN to accept this. Probably my fault. Corrections very welcome. Basically the
client says it's fine, but the server says "VERIFY ERROR: depth=1, error=invalid CA certificate: CN=working-ca"

Execute:

    make

Once it is done, you will have:

* root-ca/root-ca.key -- private key of the root certificate authority
* root-ca/root-ca.crt -- self-signed certificate of the root certificate authority
* root-ca/root-ca.srl -- (you can ignore)

* working-ca/working-ca.key -- private key of the working certificate authority
* working-ca/working-ca.csr -- certificate request for the working certificate authority (you can ignore)
* working-ca/working-ca.crt -- certificate of the working certificate authority, issued by the root certificate authority
* working-ca/working-ca.srl -- (you can ignore)

* client/client.key -- key for the OpenVPN client
* client/client.csr -- certificate request of the client (you can ignore)
* client/client.crt -- certificate for the OpenVPN client, issued by the working certificate authority
* client/client-chain.crt -- combo file that contains both client/client.crt and working-ca/working-ca.crt

* server/server.key -- key for the OpenVPN server
* server/server.csr -- certificate request of the server (you can ignore)
* server/server.crt -- certificate for the OpenVPN server, issued by the root certificate authority
