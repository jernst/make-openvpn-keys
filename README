This provides Makefiles that generate the keys needed for OpenVPN, without
EasyRSA (which may be easy, but is confusing as hell)

There are two versions:
* single-ca: a single certificate authority, which issues a client cert and a server cert
* root-ca-and-ca: there is a root certificate authority, which issues a cert for a working
  certificate authority, which issues a client cert and a server cert

The second form makes it easier to recover from compromised servers if you don't keep the
key of the root certificate authority on the server, and you have lots of users. If you
don't have lots of users, don't bother and go with the first.
